"""The agent on Claude Code (the Claude Agent SDK). AUTOPILOT_AGENT=claude picks it.

The game's tools (probe, run_harness, snapshot, restart_level, report) are an in-process MCP server whose bodies are
Session's (autopilot/agents/session.py). Claude Code's own tools are limited to reading, searching and writing files,
and a hook holds them to this game's folder: it may read the game's folder and the kit, and write only this run's
folder, notes.md and lib.py.

Research subagents: the main agent may start `researcher` subagents (the SDK's Agent tool, ClaudeAgentOptions.agents)
that answer one codex question each from the game's files alone, up to RESEARCHERS at once (AUTOPILOT_RESEARCHERS;
off by default, 0). A researcher gets Read, Grep and Glob only; the same hook runs for its calls (the CLI marks them
with agent_id / agent_type) and refuses it the game's tools, writes and subagents of its own. The other agents
(OpenCode, Codex) have no subagents.
