"""The agent is the user's own Claude Code or Codex, on the user's own plan: Autopilot is an MCP server it uses
(`autopilot mcp`, autopilot/mcp.py), not an agent Autopilot runs. Everything else is a run as the editor's Play makes
one (cli.run_prompt): the game started and its codex read, Jev deciding, the recording, steering, the result in the
Autopilot tab, the memory and (shared) the run's data.

    Control     in `autopilot serve` (the agent service the editor's plugin started): a localhost endpoint whose address
                (with a secret) brain.json gives as "control", which `autopilot mcp` finds it by. POST <control>/start
                starts a run with this module as its agent (cmd_serve decides whether one may start); POST
                <control>/call/<tool> is a tool call on the run going. Answers are an MCP tool result as JSON
                ({"content": [...], "isError"}).
    Desk        one run's: the start call's answer once its session is open, then each tool call handed to the session
                (one at a time, as every agent's), until the run ends.
    implement() the agent's entry point, as every agent's: the session opened, INSTRUCTIONS.md (the instructions every
                agent gets, and this route's tools) and REQUEST.md (the request and its briefing) written in the run's
                folder, the start call answered; then it waits while the user's agent calls the tools, until it
                reports, the user stops the run (the tab's Stop), the time is up or the agent stops calling.

Calls wait as long as they take here: `autopilot mcp` answers "still going" when one takes long (its client gives up
on a slow call: Codex after 60 s) and gives the result to the next `wait`.

Looking at the picture: the user's agent hands an episode's frames (`frames`, JPEGs) to a subagent of its own told
only open questions (docs/architecture.md, "Looking at the picture"), so the description comes from the user's plan
too. describe_frames (Autopilot's own vision model) stays a fallback, where the run has a key or Aura for one.

You are the user's own coding agent, working through Autopilot's MCP server (`autopilot`). Its tools: the game's
(probe, run_harness, snapshot, restart_level, report, and frames and describe_frames, below), wait, and file tools for
this game's folder: read_file, list_files and search (this game's folder and the kit: autopilot/KIT.md,
autopilot/kit/), write_file and edit_file ({run}/harness.py and other files in {run}/, notes.md, lib.py: nothing else
may be changed). Paths are relative to this game's folder, which isn't your working directory: use these file tools
for it, never your own, and don't touch the user's project or the game's files with your own tools. Act on the game
only through the game's tools.

Call the game's tools one at a time: the game runs only inside a call and is paused between them. A call that takes
long (an episode, starting the game) answers "still going": call wait until it gives the result. Every game tool
answers with the time used of the run's budget. Once report says "Reported", the run is over: tell the user its
outcome in a few lines (the Autopilot tab in their editor shows the whole result).

## Looking at the picture here

Here describe_frames above means a describer subagent of yours, not a model of Autopilot's: hand it the moment, it
looks at the episode's frames (the `frames` tool) and answers your open questions. Don't call `frames` yourself:
reading frames while you know what you hope to see colours what you see. Brief it with this, filled in, and nothing
else (never the request, the claim, the harness or what you expect):

    Call the autopilot tool `frames` with episode=<n>, start=<game time>, end=<game time>, count=<up to {max_frames}>.
    Then describe the frames. {describer}
    Questions:
    1. <an open question: what moves and how, what is at a spot, what the text says; never yes/no>
    {sweep}

In Claude Code use the `frame-describer` subagent when there is one (Autopilot's Claude Code plugin adds it), else a
general-purpose one. In Codex spawn the `frame_describer` agent when there is one, else a new agent, with nothing of
this conversation forked into it. Hold its description against what true and false would look like, written down
before you asked; a request about how something looks is CONFIRMED or DENIED only on such a description (report it
with visual: true). describe_frames, Autopilot's own describer, is a fallback for when no subagent of yours can take
pictures: it works only where the user has a key (or Aura) for one.
