"""The link between the brain and the plugin in the game (Unreal, Unity or Godot). The wire format is in
docs/protocol.md.

The plugin connects out to the brain over a WebSocket; ``serve_local()`` listens for it on this machine and returns a
``Link`` once the plugin has said hello. Through the link the brain sends requests to the game (``request``, ``post``)
and receives events (findings, logs, heartbeats) and control frames (start, stop, steer).

Errors from the game are ``BridgeError``s (an HTTP-style status and message, as the plugin sent them). A lost
connection, or a request the game doesn't answer in time, raises ``requests.ConnectionError``.
