"""Autopilot from the command line.

    python -m autopilot serve [--port 8765] [--project PATH] [--aura]
        Wait for the editor's Autopilot tab to connect, then run each Verify, Play or Explore it starts.
    python -m autopilot play "Sell three crops at the market stall" [--port 8765] [--project PATH]
        Wait for the plugin to connect, then research, write and run a harness for one prompt and exit with its
        result (see EXIT).
    python -m autopilot codex --project PATH [--name NAME]
        Build a project's codex (the game's code as text) without the game running.
    python -m autopilot run memory/<project>/runs/<run>/harness.py [--seconds 60] [--no-restart]
        Play a saved harness again, with no language model (Jev decides), e.g. to watch it.
    python -m autopilot uninstall [--keep-memory] [--yes]
        Remove Autopilot from this computer: its settings, keys, sign-in, memory and command (autopilot/uninstall.py).
        Shared run data already sent stays.
    python -m autopilot mcp
        Autopilot's tools for your own Claude Code or Codex (an MCP server on stdio: autopilot/mcp.py), which then
        works on the game open in the editor on your own plan (`serve`, started by the plugin, runs it).
    python -m autopilot connect claude|codex [--remove]
        Set up your own Claude Code or Codex for that: the MCP server, a skill and a frame describer
        (autopilot/connect.py); --remove takes them out.

--aura signs in with Aura: runs are billed to your Aura plan (autopilot/aura.py), instead of using your own keys. So
does choosing Aura in a plugin's first-run setup (read before every run: autopilot/account.py), whose sign-in the plugin
asks this agent service for. Without the Aura app, a run with no sign-in opens Aura's sign-in in the browser; `autopilot
login` signs in ahead of time and `autopilot logout` signs out (autopilot/aura_login.py).

PATH is any engine's project: an Unreal .uproject (or its folder), a Unity project folder (the one with
ProjectSettings/), or a Godot project.godot (or its folder).
