"""Research helpers for probes: the codex's data tables and a grep over it without a model turn per look, and
measurements on the live game (the actors nearest the player, a teleport that sets up a measurement, a fight trial
that says whether and how fast a target can be beaten, an enemy's profile measured without fighting it, the first
function name a game accepts).

The probe namespace (autopilot/agents/session.py, Session._namespace) adds NAMES (name -> callable; names_for(game)
binds the codex helpers' root to the game's codex) and DOC goes into the agent's instructions (KIT.md's style). A real
run spent 47 model turns on greps over 580 KB of CSV data tables and never tested the goal's last step: these do that
work in one probe, so the agent's turns go to checking what the game does.

The codex helpers read memory/<project>/codex/ (autopilot/codex.py): a root is a path, an autopilot.codex.Codex, or a
game (its .codex); ROOT is the default when a call gives none. The game helpers wrap GameError with what was tried.

- `tables()`: the codex's data tables: [{"name", "path", "rows", "struct"}]. `rows("DT_Enemies", where="Goblin")`: a
  table's rows as dicts (column -> value; numbers as numbers; a nested `(Key=Value,...)` struct as its text); `where`:
  a regex over the row's name, or {column: substring}. `row("DT_Enemies", "Goblin")`: one row by its name.
  `cell(value, "Drops.0.Chance")`: a field out of a struct's text (`cell(value)`: the whole struct as dicts and lists).
- `grep(r"ApplyDamage", where="blueprints", limit=50)`: "path:line: text" of the lines matching a regex across the
  codex (or one of its folders): many looks in one probe, not one model turn each.
- `nearest(game, "BP_Goblin", n=5, within=3000)`: actors of a class by distance from the player: [(path, Vec,
  distance)].
- `teleport(game, to, actor=None, why="research")`: move the player's pawn (or `actor`) to a Vec, or next to an actor
  path (150 short of it, facing it; {"near": path, "distance": 300} for another distance). A direct change, only to set
  up a measurement in a probe (never in a harness: play is Jev's, through inputs); every one is reported.
- `fight_trial(game, target, key="LeftMouseButton", seconds=20, reach=None, heal=True)`: a measurement: get in reach
  of the target (an actor path or a class name: its nearest; teleported near it, then walked the last stretch so the
  player stands on the game's own ground), look at it, press `key` every 0.6 s, reading its health and the player's
  each swing; when the first swings land nothing, once closer (0.6 of the reach) -> {swings, hits, damage_per_hit,
  target_health, player_health, damage_taken, killed, player_dead, stance: {distance, height: the target's box bottom
  above the player's feet}, closer, healed, verdict...}. Tells, before the harness is written, whether the fight can be
  won and how long it takes (health="Prop" names the health property when Health/CurrentHealth/HP aren't the game's).
  heal=True writes the player's health back to what it was (reported), so the next measurement doesn't start hurt; a
  player the trial killed stays dead (player_dead: restart the level).
- `enemy_profile(game, target, seconds=20, safe_distance=None)`: a measurement without a fight: the player watches the
  target from 1200 away (teleported there) for `seconds` -> {comes (whether it came at the player), approach_speed,
  speed, player_speed, attack_range (the distance at the first drop of the player's health), attack_period,
  damage_per_hit, regen_per_s (its health rising on its own; after damage: run fight_trial first), summary...}. The
  player is kept alive (under 40% health it is teleported back) and healed afterwards.
- `call_any(game, obj, ["GiveItem", "AddItem", "AddToInventory"], Item=..., Amount=1)`: the first function name the game
  accepts -> {"called", "result"}; GameError with every refusal when none is."""
