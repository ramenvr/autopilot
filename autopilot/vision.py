"""Looking at the game's picture, for a request about how something looks (an animation, an effect, a material or
light, the UI): the frames the run's recording got lately, described in words by a vision model that is never told
the request (docs/architecture.md, "Looking at the picture").

    Frames      the recording's latest frames (JPEG, with the game and wall time each shows), in memory: the last
                KEPT_BYTES of them, so the last few minutes of play.
    Describer   a run's describe_frames: picks up to MAX_FRAMES of an episode's frames, sends them with the agent's
                questions (and SWEEP) to the vision model and returns its description. The model sees the frames and
                the questions only: what the agent hopes to see can't colour what it is told is there.
    route()     which API and model describe frames for a run: the agent's own provider's (Aura's relay in a run
                through Aura), a model that takes pictures; None, with why, when the provider has none.

The description is all the agent gets: no agent takes pictures in its tool results (Codex's image viewing is off,
OpenCode's and the game tools' results are text), and an agent reading frames itself would read them knowing what it
hopes to see. The one exception is the user's own Claude Code or Codex (autopilot/agents/external.py): it is handed
the frames (Describer.frames_of) for a subagent of its own to describe, told only the questions, so the description
comes from the user's plan too.
