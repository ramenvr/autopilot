name: autopilot
description: Playtest the game open in the user's Unreal, Unity or Godot editor with Autopilot (its `autopilot` MCP server) - explore the game for bugs, test it (go over it and report every problem), verify a claim about how it works or looks, or reach a goal in play. Use when the user asks to playtest, test, verify, check or explore their game, or to use Autopilot.

# Playtesting with Autopilot

Autopilot plays the game open in the user's editor: a fast decision model makes the choices in play, inside a
harness you write for this game and this request. You research the game's code, try things in the live game, write
and revise the harness, and report what play showed. Its tools come from the `autopilot` MCP server.

1. The game's project must be open in Unreal, Unity or Godot with the Autopilot plugin, its Autopilot tab connected.
   When start_run says Autopilot's agent service isn't running, tell the user that and stop.
2. Call `start_run` with the request in the user's words and its kind. A request is one of four types:
   - an exploration ("Explore the crafting system in Lvl_Main"): `explore`, with `minutes` of play when the user
     gives them;
   - a test ("Go through the currently open level and tell me everything that looks wrong"): `explore` too, as it
     plays as an exploration;
   - a verification ("Verify that the tree shakes when you hit it with an axe"): `verify`;
   - a goal ("Kill the boss while keeping your health above 20% of its maximum value"): `goal`.
   Pass `time_limit_minutes` when the user gives a time limit.
3. Read the INSTRUCTIONS.md it names, all of it, with Autopilot's `read_file` (in parts: it is long). Follow it: it is
   how to work, what the kit is, and the rules a report must meet.
4. A call that answers "still going" (an episode, the game starting) isn't done: call `wait` until it gives the
   result.
5. To look at the game's picture, never call `frames` yourself: hand the episode, the game times and open questions
   (nothing about the request or what you expect) to the `frame-describer` subagent, as INSTRUCTIONS.md says.
6. If start_run asks for the decision model's key, tell the user where it goes (the file or the Autopilot tab it
   names). Never ask them to paste a key into this conversation.
7. Once `report` says "Reported", the run is over: tell the user its outcome in a few lines. The Autopilot tab in
   their editor shows the whole result, with the recording.

Use Autopilot's own file tools for the game's folder (paths relative to it), never your own, and don't change the
user's project or the game's files: the game is acted on only through play, with Autopilot's tools. The user can
watch the run in the Autopilot tab, stop it there, or steer it (what they type there reaches you with your next tool
result).
