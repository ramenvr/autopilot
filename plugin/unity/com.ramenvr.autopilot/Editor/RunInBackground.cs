// While a run plays the game in this editor, the game keeps running when the editor isn't the window in front. Play mode
// follows Player Settings' Run In Background: with it off, an unfocused editor runs play mode at a frame every second
// or so, and the brain's requests time out. It is turned on as a run starts and put back as it was when the run is
// over (what it was is kept in SessionState, across script reloads; not in batch mode, which doesn't slow down), or as
// this package is removed (its code is gone after that script reload: nothing would put it back).
