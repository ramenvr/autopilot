// The bridge to the brain (docs/protocol.md): one WebSocket out to the brain, JSON text frames. The socket lives on
// background threads; everything that touches the game runs on the main thread, in Tick() (every frame), where all
// requests that arrived since the last frame are handled, many per frame. Deferred answers (move, watch, key taps,
// codex, session changes) are Pending entries ticked each frame until they answer.
//
// Or a link in place of the WebSocket (ConnectLink): another editor plugin carries the same frames to the brain over a
// connection of its own (Aura's, Editor/HostLink.cs). Frames out go to its send on the main thread, in Tick; frames in
// come through LinkReceive from any thread, and are handled in Tick as the socket's are.
